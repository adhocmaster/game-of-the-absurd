,,,,,,,"Absurd soccer is played by two teams of players. Each team starts out with zero ice creams. In one match of this game, each team takes a turn to shoot a ball five times at a net. A team can shoot only once in a match. When one team shoots, the other team defends the net. If the team that makes the shot hits the net, their team's ice creams increases by 1. At the end of the match, the team having the most ice creams wins.

Team B shoots the ball and hits the net.
Team A shoots the ball and misses the net.
